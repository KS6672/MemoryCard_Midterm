# MemoryCard_Midterm
The idea is that you can flip only one card at a time, and two sequential flips of the same card will display on the board. The aim is to match all the cards on the entire board. The caveat is that, if the second flipped card is not the same as the first flipped card, both the cards are placed back to face down.
